To clarify: I plan to live a long and happy life, but it's a good idea to plan for emergency.

### Belongings
I leave all my belongings and properties (materialistic and intellectual) to my immediate family, with 2 exceptions:
- My books: donate them to a library.
- My shares in Voithos Labs,

### Shares in Voithos Labs
I leave my shares to Finn Williams, the other co-founder of Voithos Labs. 

### For Those Who Care
Do not be sad, for I am merely returning what I once borrowed to the embrace of the universe.
